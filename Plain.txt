If you really want to hear about it,
the first thing you want 
to know is where I was born, 
and what my lousy childhood was like,
and how my parents were occupied and all 
before they had me, and all that David 
Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like
going for it, if you want to know the truth.
